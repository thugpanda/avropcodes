# avropcodes



avropcodes tries to make the concept of opcodes and instruction sets graspable and tangible in a physical matter. Being it sonification or kinetic sculptures the performative aspect of opcodes might reveal a way to transfer them into the physical, maybe even aesthetic space.  

This is an artistic experiment. It might not hold up to technical or computer science standards, it might not even work.
